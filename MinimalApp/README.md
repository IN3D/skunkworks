# Minimal App

### Overall:
Still in development.

**Abstract**: The goal here is to test if a single page app can be reiably built
without bringing in a flavor of the week sort of library like React or Vue. Not
that there's strictly something wrong with them, but I believe that they present
some challenges to UX by escewing the actual DOM for a virtual DOM
implementation. A lot of existing UX and UI libraries are dependent on DOM
manipulation like basically any CSS Framework, Any mobile gesture library,
drag-and-drop etc.

### Final thoughts:
TBD
